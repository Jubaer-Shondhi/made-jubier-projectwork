# Project Plan

## Title
Analysis of police encounters in the United States

## Main Question

How do victims' age, gender, and threat level from the victim influence the frequency and outcomes of police encounters in the United States?

## Description

This project analyzes police encounters in the United States, focusing on how victims' age, gender, and perceived threat level influence the frequency and outcomes of these incidents. Despite a 1994 mandate, there remains no comprehensive federal record on police use of force, with estimates indicating 930 to 1,240 fatalities annually. Media-led databases, such as The Counted by The Guardian and The Washington Postâ€™s tracking of police shootings, report thousands of fatalities since 2015. By examining these factors, this analysis aims to reveal patterns and contribute to informed discussions on law enforcement practices and public safety. The dataset includes over 7,700 records from 2015 to 2022, detailing victim demographics, incident circumstances, and geolocation data.
