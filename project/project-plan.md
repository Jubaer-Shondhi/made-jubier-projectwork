## Title
Tracing the Climate Impact: Examining CO₂ Emission Effects on Temperature Patterns in Brazil

## Main Question

How do CO₂ emissions correlate with temperature trends in Brazil?

## Description

By analyzing historical data on CO2 levels and temperatures specific to Brazil, we aim to explore whether increased CO2 emissions are linked to rising temperatures within the country. Typically, higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere are associated with warmer temperatures. Understanding this relationship in Brazil’s context helps us assess the impacts of climate change, providing insights that can inform strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate the effects of global warming at a national level.
