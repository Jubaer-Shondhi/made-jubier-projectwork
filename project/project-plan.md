# Project Plan

## Title
Exploring the relationship between eating out frequency and daily caloric intake across food categories in the U.S

## Main Question

Does eating out frequently lead to higher daily caloric intake from specific food categories?

## Description

This project examines the potential link between eating out frequency and increased daily caloric intake across various food categories. Using two datasets—one detailing calories in specific food items and the other capturing eating habits and daily calorie consumption—the goal is to determine whether people who eat out more frequently tend to consume higher-calorie foods overall. This analysis will shed light on dietary patterns related to eating out, providing insights into the impact of dining choices on caloric intake. Understanding this relationship could help inform dietary guidelines and strategies for healthier eating habits, particularly in urban and fast-paced environments where eating out is common.
